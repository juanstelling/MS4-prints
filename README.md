### 1.6 Design 

- #### Frameworks

[The Bootstrap front-end framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) is used through the project. Bootstrap provides a quick design, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components and a modern interface for the project.  

- #### Colour scheme 
The four colours that are used for the website are very simple and calm colours. These colours are used because the colours give a sleek and modern look. 
The products stand out of the calm and sleep appearance of the colours.

![Colour scheme](readme_img/colour_scheme.png)

- #### Fonts
The **Oswald** form is used throughout the whole website. The sans serif font serves as fallback in case the main font isn’t being imported to the site correctly. The Oswald font us used for all text on the website. This font is used because the font is sleek and clear and is easy to read. The font is used in uppercase letters for all titles and lowercase letters are mainly used for paragraphs. 

- #### Icons
The icons in the project are provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). All icons that are used have functional purposes such as the hamburger menu for the mobile version and social media icons.

- #### Images

5. Create a superuser. The superuser has acces to the admin environment.
    - `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
    - Enter your username, email and password.
6. Run the app: Open your terminal window in your IDE. Type: `python3 manage.py runserver` and run the app.
7. To acces the admin environment, you can add `/admin` at the end of your url and login with the superuser.


#### Heroku Deployment  
1. Set up local workspace for Heroku 
    - In terminal window of your IDE type: `pip3 freeze -- local > requirements.txt.` (The file is needed for Heroku to know which filed to install.)
    - Create a Procfile with the following text: `web: gunicorn <name app>.wsgi:application` (The file is needed for Heroku to know which file is needed as entry point.)
    - Push all these files to your GitHub reposity.
2. Set up Heroku
    - Create a Heroku account and create a new app and select your region. 
    - Go to resources in Heroku and search for **postgess**. Select **Hobby dev - Free** and click on the provision button to add it to the project.
    - Go to the settings app in Heroku and go to **Config Vars**. Click on **Reveal Config Vars** and add the following config variables:

    | KEY            | VALUE         |
    |----------------|---------------|
    | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<aws access key>`  |
    | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<aws secret access key>`  |
    | DATABASE_URL| `<postgres database url>`  |
    | EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `<email password(generated by Gmail)>` |
    | EMAIL_HOST_USER| `<email address>`  |
    | MAILCHIMP_API_KEY| `<api key>`  |
    | MAILCHIMP_DATA_CENTER| `<datacenter id>`  |
    | MAILCHIMP_EMAIL_LIST_ID| `<emailist id>`  |
    | SECRET_KEY | `<your secret key>`  |
    | STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY| `<your stripe public key>`  |
    | STRIPE_SECRET_KEY| `<your stripe secret key>`  |
    | STRIPE_WH_SECRET| `<your stripe wh key>`  |
    | USE_AWS | `True`  |

3. Set up Database
    - Copy the **DATABASE_URL** (Postgres URL) from the config variables of Heroku and past it into the default database in `setting.py`

    ```
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse("<DATABASE_URL here>")
    }
    ```
    **NOTE:** This setup for the databases is temporary for deployment to Heroku.
    - Migrate the models to create the database by the following commands:
        - `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
        - `python3 manage.py migrate`
    - Load the data fixtures for categories and product in this exact order:
        - `python3 manage.py loaddata categories`
        - `python3 manage.py loaddata products`
    - Create a superuser. The superuser has acces to the admin environment.
        - `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
        - Enter your username, email and password.
    - Now you can remove the DATABASE_URL from `settings.py` and set the 'old' default DATABSE settings.
    - Adjust the ALLOWED_HOSTS in you settings.py with the following:
    
    ```
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['<your Heroku app URL>', 'localhost]
    ```
    - Push the code to Github.
4. Connect with Heroku 
    - Click on the **Connect to GitHub** section in the deploy tab in Heroku. 
        - Search your repository to connect with it.
        - When your repository appears click on **connect** to connect your repository with the Heroku. 
    - Set automatic deploment: Go to the deploy tab in Heroku and scroll down to **Aotmatic deployments**. Click on **Enable Automatic Deploys**. By **Manual deploy** click on **Deploy Branch**.
Heroku will receive the code from Github and host the app using the required packages. 
Click on **Open app** in the right corner of your Heroku account. The app wil open and the live link is available from the address bar. 

#### Hosting static and media files with AWS
The static and media files are hosted in the AWS S3 Bucket. To host them you will need an account and create an S3 bucket and set a group, policy and user in the IAM environment. 
Read more about the the S3 Bucket storage [here](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). For more information about the storage in your project [click here](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html).
